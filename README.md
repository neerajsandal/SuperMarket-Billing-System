# SuperMarket-Billing-System

**Introduction:**
This project is a C++ implementation of a billing system for a supermarket. It provides two main roles: Administrator and Buyer. The Administrator can manage the database by adding, modifying, or deleting products. The Buyer can select items they want to purchase, and the system generates a bill accordingly.

**Features:**
1. **Administrator:**
   - Add products to the database: The administrator can add new products to the supermarket's inventory. Each product contains information such as name, price, quantity, etc.
   - Modify product details: The administrator can update the details of existing products, such as price, quantity, or any other relevant information.
   - Delete products: Unnecessary or outdated products can be removed from the database by the administrator.

2. **Buyer:**
   - View product list: The buyer can view the list of available products in the supermarket along with their details like name, price, and quantity.
   - Select items for purchase: The buyer can choose the products they want to buy and specify the quantity required.

3. **Billing:**
   - The system calculates the total bill based on the selected items and quantities.
   - Applicable discounts are automatically applied.
   - The final bill is displayed to the buyer.
